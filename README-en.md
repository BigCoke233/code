# Noter
> üìù Be a Noter.
## Introduction
This project was developed based on [Github-issues-blog](https://github.com/wuhaoworld/github-issues-blog). You can use it to write articles or take notes by creating issues.  
The UI is based on [MDUI](https://www.mdui.org/). In the future, I will design the UI without MDUI.

## Usage
1. Clone/Download or just Fork.
2. Change the domain name in the CNAME file or delete it.
3. Set options in the `config.js` file.
4. Create issues.
5. Visit your site.
